# Made for [Dank Trades](https://discord.gg/uVbsespFFx)

## Features | Modules (Complete)
- Allocate Moderators to particular categories helping them to focus. Thus keeping the server smoothly functioning.
- Middlemen can use the `mmt` command which gives two users access to the MM Trading channel and monitors the number of times they used the command. Allows admins to keep track of who is being lazy and demote them.

### In-Development Features
- Blacklist, which allows admins to blacklist a user and also makes sure they stay blacklisted even if they rejoin the server.

## Resources
- **Help Command** borrowed from [NONChris' GIST](https://gist.github.com/nonchris/1c7060a14a9d94e7929aa2ef14c41bc2) and improvised.

## Running
- This bot is only meant to run for Dank Trades. If you want to run it, no support will be provided for that matter.
